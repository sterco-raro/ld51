Ludum Dare 51

### BUGFIX

To correctly package the game this array must be added to the spec file generated by PyInstaller:
```
datas=[
	( "code/*.py", "code" ),
	( "code/components/*.py", "code/components" ),
	( "code/systems/*.py", "code/systems" ),
	( "code/worlds/*.py", "code/worlds" ),
	( "graphics/*.png", "graphics" ),
	( "graphics/cursors/*.png", "graphics/cursors" ),
	( "graphics/deck/*.png", "graphics/deck" ),
	( "graphics/pipes/*.png", "graphics/pipes" ),
	( "graphics/spurt/images/*.png", "graphics/spurt/images/" ),
	( "graphics/warning/images/*.png", "graphics/warning/images" )
]
```
And we must package the executable alongside the "sounds" folder, so the final zip will be

- pipe-nightmare.zip
	- sounds/
	- pipe-nightmare
